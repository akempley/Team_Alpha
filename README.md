## 📋 Project Overview

A Flask web application for storing and viewing movie recommendations. Users can add, browse, and search for movies. 

## MVP

The Movie archive project MVP will be a streamlined, crowdsourced platform dedicated to cataloging films. Its core function allows users to search movies and be able to contribute clips of must see movies, including titles, release years, and genres. A central feature is the community-driven rating system, where users can score each film on a simple scale. Furthermore, the platform will enable the submission and display of user-written reviews for every movie entry. To visually define each title, the database will support the upload and curation of official and fan-submitted images. Ultimately, this MVP establishes the essential foundation for a community-built film resource centered on shared knowledge and opinion.
